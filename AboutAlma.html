	<h2> ❇️ Alma Potrero Edition ❇️</h2>

	<h3>Biography</h3>
	<p>I grew up and lived and in Queens, New York my whole life. I go to Actvf, and when I graduate I would like to major in pre-med. I am a golden globe winner and the mayor gave me the key to the city.</p>

	<p>I live with both of my parents, my brother and my dog, my dog is my favorite out of all of them :) I like the colors purple and blue. My favorite vegetables are broccoli and cucumber. I love my friends very much, they bring me joy and make me laugh.  💛💛💛</p>
	
	<h3>Technology</h3>
	<p> I use my phone every single day. I use it to get on social media, to watch youtube, netflix, hulu and to play games. Although I do use my phone to watch things I like to use my smart tv more (larger screen, better quality). I also have a laptop that I do homework on, but it doesnt always work so I have to use my phone. My phone is my lord and savior.</p>
